## [1.6.1] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- **Filename Template**: New setting under **Downloads** that takes a template for the exported filename. Supported placeholders: `{date}`, `{datetime}`, `{handle}`, `{author}`, `{id}`, `{slug}`, `{type}`. Each value is sanitized for filesystem-invalid characters (`/\:*?"<>|`), the final filename is capped at 120 characters, and the settings view shows a live preview. Leave blank to keep the previous default (`{handle}-{id}.md` for tweets/threads, `{handle}-{slug}.md` for articles). An info popover next to the field lists every placeholder with a short description. Combines with the **Downloads Subfolder** setting from 1.6.0. (#24)
- **Frontmatter Field Picker**: New **Frontmatter fields** section in Settings that lets you pick exactly which entries appear in the YAML frontmatter via per-field toggle switches (e.g. drop `views` or `bookmarks` if your notes don't need engagement counts). Selections are saved separately for the default schema and the Obsidian-friendly schema, so flipping the toggle preserves each set. An **Activate all** button restores every field for the active mode. The picker greys out when **Include metadata** is off (no frontmatter to filter); flipping **Obsidian-friendly frontmatter** on automatically enables **Include metadata**, and flipping **Include metadata** off automatically disables **Obsidian-friendly frontmatter** — the two toggles stay coherent. Field labels lay out column-major (top-to-bottom in col 1, then col 2) so related entries scan together. Saved maps treat missing keys as enabled, so newly-added fields in future versions won't silently disappear. (#25)
- **Version in Footer**: The popup footer now shows the installed extension version (e.g. `v1.6.1`) on the left, read from `chrome.runtime.getManifest().version` so it stays in sync with the manifest automatically. Useful when reporting bugs or confirming an auto-update landed.

### Changed

- **Collapsible Settings Sections**: The four Settings groups (Downloads, Obsidian, Frontmatter fields, Inline button & context menu) are now each collapsible. Downloads + Obsidian are open by default; the other two start collapsed to keep the panel short. At most **two** sections can be expanded at once — opening a third evicts the oldest from a most-recently-used list and closes it. Opening **Frontmatter fields** also opens **Obsidian** (whose Obsidian-friendly toggle decides which Frontmatter mode is shown); closing Obsidian implicitly closes Frontmatter. The last open layout is persisted across popup sessions.
- **Settings Topbar**: The "Hover over labels for more info" hint moved to a small ⓘ icon at the top-right (level with the Back button) with the localized text as its tooltip. Long translations (Spanish, German, Persian, Portuguese) wouldn't fit inline on the 352px popup, so the icon keeps the topbar one row tall in every locale. The popup footer (Issues hint + GitHub icon) is now hidden in the Settings view to reduce visual noise.
- **Instant CSS Tooltips**: All label and button tooltips in the popup migrated from native `title=` (which had a ~500ms OS-controlled delay and could render outside the popup window) to a unified CSS tooltip pattern. They wait 500ms before appearing — same as native — but the timing is now controllable via two CSS variables (`--tooltip-delay`, `--tooltip-fade`), tooltips stay inside the popup, and the styling matches the rest of the UI.
- **Toolbar Icon**: The four extension icons (16/32/48/128) now have a transparent background, removing the visible white square frame that showed up against Chrome's dark-mode toolbar. The dark navy badge artwork is unchanged; only the corner pixels were knocked out via a corner-anchored floodfill, with a tiny alpha-channel blur to keep the rim clean (no antialiasing halo).

## [1.6.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- **Downloads Subfolder**: New setting under **Downloads** that places exported Markdown and images inside a subfolder of the browser's Downloads folder, instead of dumping everything at the top level. Leave blank for the previous behavior. Traversal (`..`), leading slashes, and illegal filename characters are stripped before the path is handed to `chrome.downloads.download`. (#17)
- **Obsidian Vault Subfolder**: New setting under **Obsidian** that creates the note inside a specified subfolder of the vault (e.g. `Tweets` or `Inbox/Tweets`) via the `file=` parameter of the `obsidian://new` URI. Traversal segments and stray slashes are stripped. Leave blank to keep notes at the vault root. (#18)

### Changed

- **Extension Name**: Renamed to *X Threads Articles to Markdown or Obsidian* across all 9 supported locales for better Chrome Web Store search match. The manifest now references `__MSG_extensionName__` so each locale ships a translated name; `short_name` stays as `tweet2md` for the OS-level short label.

### Fixed

- **Obsidian handoff vs. close-after-export**: When *Add tweet to Obsidian* was triggered from the context menu on a timeline (which opens a new tab) with **Close the new tab after export** enabled, the tab was closed before the browser's "Open Obsidian.app?" prompt could be confirmed, dropping the handoff. The auto-close now skips the Obsidian action so the user can answer the prompt; download/copy actions still respect the toggle. (#16)

## [1.5.1] - 2026-05-16

### Security

- **Hostname Sanitization**: Replaced substring-based host checks (e.g. `url.includes('pbs.twimg.com')`) with proper URL parsing via a new `hostMatches` helper that compares parsed hostnames exactly. Fixes 9 CodeQL `js/incomplete-url-substring-sanitization` alerts across `content/article.ts`, `content/markdown.ts`, `content/tweet.ts`, and `popup/popup.ts`. The popup's "are we on x.com?" gate is tightened from a substring test to an exact host match against the manifest's allowed hosts.

### Changed

- **Extension Description**: The Chrome Web Store / manifest description now mentions the Obsidian handoff. Updated across all 9 supported locales.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- **Add to Obsidian**: One-click handoff that opens Obsidian via the `obsidian://new` URI scheme with the rendered Markdown prefilled. Forces Obsidian-friendly frontmatter and leaves images as remote URLs (local image downloads don't make sense for a URI handoff). The handoff is local — no network call.
- **Obsidian-friendly Frontmatter**: Optional export schema with wikilinked author handles (e.g. `[[@username]]`) for backlinks, a synthesized title, `published` / `created` date split, prose `description` snippet, and a `tags: [clippings, x, <type>]` array. Engagement metrics remain at the bottom for Dataview queries. Toggle off = byte-for-byte identical to the previous schema.
- **Obsidian Vault Setting**: Optional vault name field in Settings; included as `vault=` in the deeplink so notes land in a specific vault. Leave blank to let Obsidian pick the last-used vault.
- **Link Cards**: External link previews in tweets are now captured. Extracts the title, source domain, and embeds the Open Graph preview image (intentionally kept as a remote URL to avoid pulling third-party thumbnails into local sibling folders).
- **Multi-View Popup**: The popup now separates primary actions from configuration. The settings view sits behind a gear icon at the top-right of the popup; clicking it slides to the configuration panel.

### Changed

- **Grouped Settings**: The "Inline button & context menu" toggles plus Obsidian settings (toggle + vault name) live in the dedicated settings view; the main popup view is focused on Download / Copy / Add to Obsidian and the per-export toggles.
- **Popup Layout**: Buttons restructured into a half-width grid — Download / Copy on top, the Export options card below, then a half-width Obsidian button with its hint paragraph paired beside it.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- **Promoted Tweet Skipping**: Thread extraction now recognises locale-aware "Ad" / "Promoted" labels (English, Japanese, German, Spanish, French, Chinese, Arabic, Persian) in the tweet header and skips them, so an ad injected mid-thread no longer ends collection at the reply boundary. (thanks @BigCactusLabs, #7)
- **K/M/B Engagement Counts**: Engagement metrics are now parsed correctly when X compacts them (e.g. `1.5K likes`, `2M views`). Previously these were dropped from the YAML frontmatter and the inline stats row. (thanks @BigCactusLabs, #7)

### Changed

- **Quoted-Tweet Media Order**: When a tweet contains both its own media and a quoted tweet, the main tweet's images/videos now appear *before* the quoted block (matching X's visual order). Media belonging to the quoted tweet is nested inside the blockquote.

### Fixed

- **Duplicate Video Poster**: When X hydrated both a poster `<img>` and a full `<video>` element for the same clip (most visible in quoted tweets), the same thumbnail was emitted twice. Now deduplicated. (thanks @BigCactusLabs, #7)

### Internal

- Added a `CONTRIBUTING.md` with the snapshot-test discipline, fixture-capture procedure, and extractor scope conventions.
- GitHub Actions CI workflow added for tests and build. `package.json` and lockfile aligned with Vitest's esbuild peer dependency. (thanks @BigCactusLabs, #8)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- **In-Place Extraction**: When you click the inline button or pick a context-menu action on a tweet you're already viewing (its permalink page), tweet2md extracts in the current tab instead of opening a duplicate one. The "Close the new tab after export" toggle never closes your active tab.
- **In-Page Toast**: In-place extractions show a brief top-center toast confirming *Copied!* / *Downloaded!* — localized in all 9 supported languages — so you have feedback without the new-tab signal.
- **Show Inline Button toggle**: A new popup toggle lets you hide the inline download icon on tweets if it conflicts visually with another extension. Off-state hides existing buttons live, no page reload needed.
- **Show Engagement Stats Inline toggle**: Optional X-style stats row in the exported Markdown (e.g. `💬 284 · 🔁 1.5K · ❤️ 8K · 🔖 253 · 👁 100K`), independent of YAML frontmatter so you can have either or both.
- **Grouped Settings**: Popup options are organized into *Export* and *Inline button & context menu* sections so 6 toggles stay scannable.

### Security

- Background download handling now validates the message sender before invoking privileged download APIs — requests are only honored from x.com content scripts or trusted extension pages.
- Local image downloads are restricted to expected X media hosts (`pbs.twimg.com`, `video.twimg.com`, `abs.twimg.com`, `abs-0.twimg.com`); other external image URLs are left as remote Markdown links rather than downloaded.
- Strengthened filename / path sanitization to drop `..` segments and absolute paths and to normalize unicode before passing to Chrome's download API.
- Contributed by [@BigCactusLabs] (#6).

### Changed

- **Inline Button Visual Match**: Icon redesigned with X's solid-fill style (no more line-art stroke) and now reads the sibling action-bar icon at decoration time to match its exact rendered size and color in every X surface (timeline vs focused tweet, light vs dark theme).
- **Cleaner Context Menu**: Save / Copy items now nest under an explicit "tweet2md" parent label instead of Chrome's auto-grouped full extension name. Also added a `short_name` in the manifest for other space-constrained UI surfaces.
- **Toast Position**: Moved to top-center with a 2-second hold so it's harder to miss.
- **Wording**: "Close tab after export" → "Close the new tab after export" — clearer that only the tab tweet2md opened will close, never your active one.
- **Internal Refactor**: `content.ts` was split into focused modules (`markdown`, `dom`, `tweet`, `article`, `wait`), and the "copy never downloads images" rule was consolidated into one shared helper. No behavior change.

### Fixed

- **Iran Flag (and other glyph) Renders As Full Image**: SVG glyphs served from `abs.twimg.com/responsive-web/client-web/...` weren't recognized as emoji and were being rendered as full-size images in the Markdown. All `.svg` images on X are now treated as glyphs and resolve to their alt-text character.
- **Tests on Fresh Checkouts**: The test suite now runs cleanly even when no local HTML/MD fixtures have been captured yet, so contributors can clone and `npm test` without setup.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- **Inline Save Button**: A download icon now sits next to the share button on every tweet's action bar. One click opens the tweet's permalink in a new tab and exports it automatically — no popup required. Long-form articles also get a button at the top so you don't have to scroll.
- **Right-Click Context Menu**: Right-click any tweet (body, image, or timestamp) and pick **Save tweet as Markdown** or **Copy tweet as Markdown**. Works across timeline, profile, and search pages.
- **Two New Toggles**: *Close tab after export* (auto-closes the new tab once extraction completes) and *Inline button copies instead* (makes the inline icon copy to clipboard rather than download).
- **Author Attribution on Quoted Tweets**: Quoted-tweet blocks now lead with the original author's name and handle.
- **Automated Test Suite**: Vitest + JSDOM snapshot tests against saved HTML fixtures cover article, tweet, quoted-tweet, and thread cases — locking the extractor's output against regressions.

### Fixed

- **Article Image Extraction**: Long-form article body images (not just the banner) now extract reliably, including via inline button / context menu where image hydration was previously racing the extractor.
- **Right-Click on Permalink Pages**: Resolved a bug where right-clicking a long-form article that contained a quoted tweet would open the *quoted* tweet instead of the page's main one.
- **Article List Continuation**: Fixed bullet/numbered lists where the next paragraph was incorrectly folded into the last list item.
- **Copy vs. Save Image Settings**: The "Save images locally" toggle no longer rewrites image URLs to nonexistent local paths when copying to clipboard — copy now always emits absolute URLs.
- **Orphaned Script Errors**: Inline-button injector now silently disconnects when the extension is reloaded or disabled, eliminating "Extension context invalidated" console noise.

### Changed

- **Permission Added**: New `contextMenus` permission required for the right-click menu. No data collection, telemetry, or external requests are introduced — see [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).
- **Localization**: Added translations for the new settings and context-menu items across all 9 supported languages.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- Added promotional web store assets to project repository.

### Changed

- **Popup UI**: Relocated the instruction hint to the header and updated the footer to include a direct link to the GitHub repository for issues and suggestions.
- **Localization**: Polished translations across 9 supported languages to ensure better native phrasing.
- **Manifest**: Updated extension metadata and localized descriptions for Web Store consistency.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- **Copy to Clipboard**: Added a "Copy .md" button to the popup to copy generated markdown directly to your clipboard instead of downloading.
- **Multi-Language UI**: Popup interface now available in 9 languages — English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Portuguese (Brazil), Chinese (Simplified), Arabic, and Persian. The UI automatically matches your browser's language. Content extraction works on any language regardless of UI translation.
- **Dynamic Theming**: Added light and dark mode support to the popup UI, automatically respecting your system preferences.

### Fixed

- **Markdown Formatting**: Fixed a bug causing improper bold and italic rendering when text nodes contained trailing or leading whitespaces.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- **Local Image Downloads**: Added a popup option to download all attached images locally into a subfolder next to the markdown file. The generated markdown automatically updates `![alt]` tags to reference the new local paths.
- **Tweet Metadata**: Added a toggle to include engagement metrics (likes, reposts, replies, bookmarks, views) as YAML frontmatter at the top of the generated markdown file.
- **Settings Persistence**: Popup toggles now remember your preferences between sessions.

### Improved

- **Quote Tweet Extraction**: Refined extraction logic to accurately differentiate between main tweet text and quoted tweet text, preventing messy or duplicated text in the output.
- **Popup UI**: Replaced basic checkboxes with modern, animated toggle switches with SVGs.
- **Path Sanitization**: Better handling of invalid characters in generated markdown and image filenames.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-15

### Initial Features

- Core extraction functionality for basic tweets, threads, and X Articles/Notes.
- Automatic DOM cleaning to strip follow buttons, engagement bars, and unwanted navigation.
- Turndown.js integration with custom rules for inline links, emojis, and @mentions.
